[#100]
== {MUST} Follow API First Principle

You must follow the <<api-first, API First Principle>>, more specifically:

* You must define APIs first, before coding its implementation,
  <<101, using OpenAPI as specification language>>
* You must design your APIs consistently with this guidelines
* You must call for early review feedback from peers and client developers,
  and apply our
  https://github.com/infinitecsolutions/dev-policies/pull/1[API review process]
  for all component external APIs, i.e. all APIs with
  `x-api-audience =/=context-internal` (see <<219, API Audience>>).

[#101]
== {MUST} Provide API Specification using OpenAPI

We use the http://swagger.io/specification/[OpenAPI specification] as standard
to define API specifications files. API designers have to provide the API
specification files using *YAML* to improve readability. We encourage to use
*OpenAPI 3.0* version, but still support *OpenAPI 2.0* (a.k.a. Swagger 2).

The API specification files should be subject to version control using a source
code management system - best together with the implementing sources.

You <<192, must / should publish>> the component <<219, external / internal>>
API specification with the deployment of the implementing service, and, hence,
make it discoverable for the group via our https://apis.zalando.net/[API Portal
[internal link]].

*Hint:* A good way to explore *OpenAPI 3.0/2.0* is to navigate through the
https://openapi-map.apihandyman.io/[OpenAPI specification mind map] and use
our https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search?search=swagger+Monte[Swagger Plugin
for IntelliJ IDEA] to create your first API. To explore and validate/evaluate
existing APIs the https://editor.swagger.io/[Swagger Editor] or our
https://apis.zalando.net[API Portal] may be a good starting point.


[#102]
== {MUST}/{SHOULD} Provide API User Manual

In addition to the API Specification, it is good practice to provide an
API user manual to improve client developer experience, especially of
engineers that are less experienced in using this API. A helpful API user
manual typically describes the following API aspects:

* API scope, purpose, and use cases
* concrete examples of API usage
* edge cases, error situation details, and repair hints
* architecture context and major dependencies - including figures and
sequence flows

Each API with an external-public, external-partner, company-internal and
platform-internal audience *must* prodive a user manual. APIs for other
audiences *should* provide one.
The user manual must be published online, e.g. via our documentation hosting platform service,
GHE pages, or specific team web servers. Please do not forget to include a link to the
API user manual into the API specification using the `#/externalDocs/url` property.

== {MUST} Write APIs in U.S. English
