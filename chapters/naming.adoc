[#129]
== {MUST} Use lowercase separate words with hyphens for Path Segments

Example:

[source,http]
----
/shipment-orders/{shipment-order-id}
----

This applies to concrete path segments and not the names of path
parameters. For example `{shipment_order_id}` would be ok as a path
parameter.

[#130]
== {MUST} Use snake_case (never camelCase) for Query Parameters

Examples:

[source]
----
customer_number, order_id, billing_address
----

[#132]
== {SHOULD} Prefer Hyphenated-Pascal-Case for HTTP header Fields

This is for consistency in your documentation (most other headers follow
this convention). Avoid camelCase (without hyphens). Exceptions are
common abbreviations like "ID."

Examples:

[source,http]
----
Accept-Encoding
Apply-To-Redirect-Ref
Disposition-Notification-Options
Original-Message-ID
----

See also: {RFC-7230}#page-22[HTTP Headers are case-insensitive (RFC 7230)].

See <<common-headers>> and <<proprietary-headers>> sections for more guidance
on HTTP headers.

[#134]
== {MUST} Pluralize Resource Names

Usually, a collection of resource instances is provided (at least API
should be ready here). The special case of a resource singleton is a
collection with cardinality 1.

[#135]
== {SHOULD} Not Use /api as Base Path

In most cases, all resources provided by a service are part of the
public API, and therefore should be made available under the root "/"
base path.

If the service should also support non-public, internal APIs
— for specific operational support functions, for example — we encourage 
you to maintain two different API specifications and provide
<<219, API audience>>. For both APIs, you should not use `/api` as base path.

We see API's base path as a part of deployment variant configuration.
Therefore, this information has to be declared in the
{OpenAPI-3-0-2}#server-object[server object].

[#136]
== {MUST} Avoid Trailing Slashes

The trailing slash must not have specific semantics. Resource paths must
deliver the same results whether they have the trailing slash or not.

[#137]
== {MUST} Stick to Conventional Query Parameters

If you provide query support for searching, sorting, filtering, and
paginating, you must stick to the following naming conventions:

* `q` — default query parameter (e.g. used by browser tab completion); should
  have an entity specific alias, like sku
* `sort` — comma-separated (as defined in <<154>>) list of fields to define
  the sort order. To indicate sorting direction, fields may be prefixed with
  `+` (ascending) or `-` (descending), e.g. /sales-orders?sort=+id
* `fields` — to retrieve only a subset of fields of a resource. See <<157>>
  below.
* `embed` — to expand or embedded sub-entities (ie.: inside of an article
  entity, expand silhouette code into the silhouette object). Implementing
  `embed` correctly is difficult, so do it with care. See <<158>> below.
* `offset` — numeric offset of the first element on a page. See <<pagination>>
  section below.
* `cursor` — an opaque pointer to a page, never to be inspected/constructed by
  clients. It usually (encrypted) encodes the identifier of the first or last
  page element, the pagination direction, and the applied query filters to
  recreate the collection. See <<pagination>> section below.
* `limit` — client suggested limit to restrict the number of entries on
  a page. See <<pagination>> section below.
